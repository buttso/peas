Hockey is a dynamic and complex game, played between two teams of fifteen to sixteen players with eleven players on the pitch at any point in time.  The game is played with two halves of thirty five minutes each with a five minute break at half time.

Coaching a team for a season requires a coach to not just address the the technical side of the game through training session activities and game play, it also requires the management of non-technical issues such as player availability, scheduling of time and location of training sessions, player performance and other team factors.

The use of technology can provide a coaching team with the ability to keep track of many of the day to day details needed to help maintain a healthy team environment as well as enabling team members to provide and update their information and input.
